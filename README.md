# Spelling-Savvy-Spell-Checker-in-Python
This project implements a **Spell Checker** using Python, inspired by [Peter Norvig's algorithm](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html).   It uses a probability-based approach on a large text corpus (`big.txt`) to suggest the most likely corrections for misspelled words.
